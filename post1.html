                        <p>I haven't been active on this page lately, mostly because I am busy or I just don't have the mood for writing a post.
                        <p>At the start of the year, I had decided to let go of writing, blogging or just merely posting things here and there and try programming. Mainly because I wanted to have a new skill that will hopefully make a transition to another job.</p>
                        <p>However, I kind of got loose that desire after a few short days. Thankfully, I haven't bought courses for any programming or coding courses. So I decided to go into writing again this month.</p>
                        <p>Maybe that's because I just re-read my journal and apparently, I said to myself to focus on writing (and vlogging, well because you also need to write for scripts or story on some vlogs but that's another story), which I've forgotten to do for several months (thank you journal and yes, I do keep a journal, religiously as much as possible).</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/writing.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">"Writing everyday keeps the bad thought away"</span>
                        <p>Well, to be honest, I still don't know if writing is for me but the goal right now is to discover that. Hopefully it'll turn out well.</p>
                        <p>As of now I don't know what kind of writing do I wanted to do. I am lost. I don't know if I would want to write a novel, just a blog, or just do some copywriting.</p>
                        <p>But, anyways, as I've said earlier, that's what I will try to discover.</p>
                        <p>I kind of don't know where to start though so I decided to make a few research here and there and I got across this 30-Day Writing Challenge.</p>
                        <p>It's kind of interesting so I decided I'll give it a try.</p>
                        <p>You can click <a href="https://www.scribendi.com/academy/articles/30_day_writing_challenge.en.html">here</a> if you're if you're interested.</p> 
                        <p>Hoping that this will turn out fine and would eventually figure out if I do love to write.</p>
                        <p>You should try this if you are an aspiring writer too.</p>
                        <p>Let's go!</p>
                        <p>Anyways, Happy Valentines Day to all!</p>
