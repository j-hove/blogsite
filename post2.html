                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <p>I had been reading this beautiful poetry book entitled "I wrote this for you and Only you" by author Iain S. Thomas, a.k.a pleasefindthis. Based on my research it's actually the second book of the poetry series.</p>
                        <p>The book has also deep and beautifully shot images of almost random things such as statues, stones, front stores and even people. Just about anything under the sun.</p>
                        <p>The poems vary from length it's in contemporary form. Not really the type with the rhyming words and with equal length of syllables. But somehow the message is deep with mind-bending questions on what the author does mean.</p>
                        <p>I wonder if the author meant a certain poem to be only understood by someone who shall receive the message. Because, although I love some poems, most of it I can't understand. Hence, the title.</p>
                        <p>Today, one of the poems I read resonated with me. I felt like the message was mine.</p>
                        <p>The poem reads:</p>
                        <blockquote class="text-center section-heading blockquote">--- The Things I Would've Said ---</blockquote>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">If you're strong enough to take that blade and draw it across your skin.
                            <br>If you're strong enough to take those pills and swallow them when no one's home.
                            <br>If you're strong enough to tie that rope and hang it from the ceiling fan.
                            <br>If you're strong enough to jump off that bridge, my friend.
                            <br>You are strong enough, to live.
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote class="section-heading blockquote text-center">--- *** ---</blockquote>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">My Take</h2>
                        <p>I've done the second line. I was strong enough to swallow those pills. However, I was weak enough to die.</p>
                        <p>I have many chances to die with an alibi. But I was weak enough to take my life.</p>
                        <p>Why? I don't know but...</p>
                        <p>As the poem suggest, I guess I am just strong enough to live.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Am I sharing this?</h2>
                        <p>I don't actually know why I did share this but I hope that for someone who feels weak right now...</p>
                        <p>To someone who thinks that their life won't matter...</p> 
                        <p>To someone who is thinking of ending it all now with their hands...</p>   
                        <p>I hope you consider things that ending it all now is not the answer...</p>
                        <p>Because, to do that, it'll take courage and strength...</p>    
                        <p>Because, to do that, it'll take courage and strength...</p>  
                        <p>And if you have that...</p>
                        <p>Maybe....</p>
                        <p>Just maybe...</p>
                        <p>You might also have it for the will to live.</p>
                        <p>You are strong enough to live.</p>
